    <h1>Automated alerting in software systems ðŸš¨</h1>

    <p>For the last decade, I have been building and operating large, distributed systems. Alerting is an important part of
    running a reliable system with high uptime.</p>

    Below are my top tips for setting up and maintaining alerts.

    ðŸ‘‰ Make alerts actionable
    Every alert that will wake up an engineer at 3 in the morning, should require an action. If alerts are not
    actionable, we stop taking them seriously, leading to on-call fatigue and eroding trust.

    Remove or tweak noisy alerts that don't require actions.

    ðŸ‘‰Test your alerts
    Use a lower environment to trigger the alert in a controlled way.
    Similar to TDD, this builds confidence that our new alert is firing and resolving on the expected conditions.

    ðŸ‘‰Take lower environment alerts seriously (but don't wake anyone up)
    CI/CD pipelines are great for verifying that tests pass and code integrates / compiles as expected, but they don't
    catch everything.

    We can use alerts from lower environments to catch problems before they hit production, like:
    - Bad DB performance of a new query
    - Degraded throughput of a service, due to a slow (but working) implementation
    - Dead-letters piling up in a queue

    ðŸ‘‰Script your alerts
    To get value from lower environment alerts, we should avoid alerts drifting out of sync across environments.
    If we script our alerts and commit them to source control, we ensure they are identical across environments.

    ðŸ‘‰Avoid manually resolving alerts
    It can be tempting to click the green "Resolve" button on the alert, as soon as we fix the issue. But how confident
    are we really in the fix?
    If we get it wrong, not only is our system still unhealthy, we're now completely blind as well.
